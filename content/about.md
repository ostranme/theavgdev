Hey there, I'm Mark :wave:.

I'm just your average developer who occasionally gets lost in the internet. You can consider this site 95% useless and 5% entertaining. The main goal is to share content and maybe make you laugh along the way.

This site contains random content as I try to poke holes through the internet. Most of the posts are about frontend related topics, with a few other tips and tricks as I try to re-create things I find online. Web development shouldn't be hard, this site attempts to put an "average" lense on problems I stumble across.
